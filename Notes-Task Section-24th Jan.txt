TASK SECTION FOR 24th JAN:

--> A sample program describing viewer on how the compiler goes about its business,
    when inputs of different data types are being fed to it either during compile or run time.

1st sample program

subject1 = int(input("enter marks secured in subject 1"))
subject2 = int(input("enter marks secured in subject 2"))
subject3 = int(input("enter marks secured in subject 3"))

if subject1>=50 and subject2>=50 and subject3>=50:
    print("Candidate has cleared the examinations")
else:
    print("Candidate has failed to clear the examination process")


2nd sample program

a = int(input("number of classes held"))
b = int(input("number of classes attended"))
engineering = input("enter engineering details")
c = b/a*100
if c >= 80 or engineering =="yes":
    print("allowed to enter assesment hall")
else:
    print("not allowed to enter assesment hall")


3rd sample program

marks=int(input("enter marks"))
if marks>=35:
    print("pass")
